                    Recently I had a conversation with an old friend about believing in yourself, weird topic to randomly discuss with a friend I know. It highlighted some strange things for which I wanted to share. Why do we as people limit ourselves? I’ll give you an example, I got on call with a buddy where he shared with me his desire to start game development, we spoke about it for a bit before I realised that it was something he really wanted to do but seemingly wouldn’t take the step to actually just dive in. Why? People often have ambition to do something great or just to start something to begin with, but they often never do – so, being the critic that I am I asked him. His response was rather typical: “I just haven’t had the time” “I will in the future” and things to that nature – but what is the point? He clearly has the desire to do it but almost tells himself that he won’t make anything of it, or it should only be something he does “for fun” while I don’t think doing things for fun is bad it strikes me as odd every time why we as people don’t just try to make something great. In an attempt to inspire him I referenced some famous businesses and projects that started something small such as amazon, upon telling him this he almost seemed perplexed – how are we not as a society pushing people to be more ambitious, there are so many young ambitious minds who could provide such great things to society but we limit them into jobs where there skillsets and creativity is not valued which to me seems like such a waste.
<br><br>
Ill end this by saying that if you believe you can make something work than I wouldn’t say strive to succeed, how about starting with strive to try.
<br><br>
Stay well,
<br><br>
Joe
