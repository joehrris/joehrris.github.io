                  Life update. <br><br>
So, since I last posted a lot of different things had happened; there have definitely been some ups and down, but such is life. I’ve officially finished ¼ of this course and the grass is definitely starting to look greener, I’ve now taught a plethora of my own lessons which are actually going really well – ive started to develop a good rapport with the students and they’ve began to respect me a little more which is honestly an incredible feeling. If you’d have asked me what my position at the school would look like a couple of months ago I wouldn’t have been able to tell you – but it definitely would not have been this, seeing progression is such as a strange feeling because at times you almost cannot envision yourself becoming better nor surpassing a version of yourself but ironically you always end up surprising yourself. This feeling kind of throws me back to a memory I have from when I was younger, my mother explained the concept of a glass ceiling to me and honestly it confused me but now the concept is so easy to understand and it’s so strange how we constantly put these false barriers on ourself of what we can achieve and what that success looks like but it’s always a falsehood. <br><br> 
On another note, I’ve managed to spend a lot more time with friends recently, from going to the pub to have a drink or going mini golf, playing some games online or just chatting over a smoke. It’s been really nice; you sometimes forget how important maintaining good relationships can be for your mental health and honestly, I’ve seen the impact that effort has had on my own mental health and now I’ve made it a priority in life and a goal moving forward.
Not too jinx anything (watch arcane if you haven’t it’s a banger series) but I feel like things are going a lot better than they were and I see no reason they shouldn’t continue the same way – I’m still struggling a little bit with my professional relationships with colleagues but overwhelming yourself with issues to fix is never the way forward so that’s an issue I will tackle in the future.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading,
<br><br>
Joe
