                <p>This is a topic I really wanted to discuss, as it’s something very personal to me that really does affect my day-to-day life. Dealing with anxiety, living with it. Especially as a professional I often find myself in situations where I struggle to say the right things or potentially end up saying the wrong things. 
I have found personally that as I’ve gotten older (22… I know I’m a fossil) I’ve become much better at coping with it and learning coping mechanisms that help me function in these sorts of environments. <br> <br>
The issue I find is that this also drastically effects my personal relationships with family, friends and romantic partners I find this difficult because it often feels like no matter how hard you try it doesn’t really get much better.  I’ve also often found that anxiety can often lead to poor attachments to people which often ends up pushing them away. <br> <br>
Finding the correct people to be around is also inherently difficult. One thing I found which I wish I knew when I was younger is that the people you surround yourself with drastically change how your brain and body responds to anxious situations and anxiety in general. If you surround yourself with people who are willing to reassure you and not become frustrated with your needs than you’ll find your experience with anxiety considerably better – it is also important to note that no one is “required” to reassure you or must deal with any issues you may have. But I’d ask you the question, if someone cannot spare the 2-3 minutes it would take to reassure you then is that someone you really need / should want in your life?
When I reflected on this the answer was easy, but I implore you to come to your own decision after sitting down and thinking about that for a while. I think you’ll look back on people who were present in your life and very quickly realise that some people are not worth the time that you want to invest into them.
Always remember that you being anxious is not an inconvenience to people who truly care for you, you’re worth it and anybody who is a true friend to you will see that and will act accordingly.
As always, thanks for reading and make sure you tune in for the next post as I’ve got some great topics to talk about. <br> <br>
Stay Safe, <br> <br>
Joe
