                <h2>Little Introduction</h2>
                <p>For my first blog post I wanted to write about something that had a big impact on my life recently and that was my transition from undergrad education to post graduate, specifically the change from BSc Computer Science to PGCE / QTS in Computer Science education.</p>
                <h2>First Expierences</h2>
                <p>Starting with the first week, I found the transition to be quite seamless, staff were pleasant and students I met on the same course seemed to be lovely to talk to and willing to develop relationships, moving a little further into the week we walked through some induction steps and the uni staff laid out their expectations of us, these were seemingly reasonable but were often quite vague at times which was confusing (p.s from the future – this didn’t get much better) <br> <br>

Moving into the second week, we were immediately given work to do with an essay assignment which was due the following week, while this was a bit of a shock, mainly because I didn’t expect to receive work like this so soon, it was generally okay as we weren’t being graded (we were but the grade didn’t count towards anything – formative assessment) Comparatively, looking back to undergraduate this was a massive change as we didn’t receive any graded work for months in undergraduate. <br> <br>

I finished that work and submitted it and have still yet to receive the results (three weeks later at the time of writing this) Moving onto the third / fourth week we were put into placements which for GDPR issues I won’t refer to by any name. The school we’ll call School B, School B so far has been a relatively good experience, the staff seem willing to help, students except for a few are a pleasure to teach and work with and I feel as if I’m starting to lean into the role and its responsibilities a lot more. I’ve had very few negative experiences which I’m very grateful for but there is part of me that is wondering If I am cut out to be a teacher, It’s been made apparent to me that my presence generally with the students isn’t good – I know this is something that comes with time but It does concern me that I could potentially not develop this skill which would massively hinder my career. <br>  


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To conclude this first little segment I’d like to thank you for taking the time to read my writing, in terms of my university experience I’d like to think everything’s going okay so far, I think the fears I’m holding in my head are a bit irrational and I’d like to think that with time I’ll develop the social and professional skills I need to thrive in this environment. 
Again, 
</p>

Yours sincerely, <br>
Joe
